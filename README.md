Ownerless AA registry

To register your AA:
- AA must have defined `var['owner']`,`var['name']`
- AA must send a payment to `WIKOOTFJPYPSAOJV63CHUXIQWFI6AGLL` one time with enough fees to cover posting. Leftover funds will be returned to trigger.initial_address
- AA must be initially triggered by `var['owner']`, otherwise it won't work and it will insult you
- Once set, it can't be changed

To use registry:
- Change username attestor address to `WIKOOTFJPYPSAOJV63CHUXIQWFI6AGLL`
- Send to @name
