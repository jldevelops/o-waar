Ownerless AA registry

To register your AA:
- AA must have defined `var['owner']`,`var['name']`
- AA must send a payment to `C67F2UX4VNZZ2RJMPBADG7PRFPZZOT4E` one time with enough fees to cover posting. Leftover funds will be returned to trigger.initial_address
- AA must be initially triggered by `var['owner']`, otherwise it will not work and it will insult you
- AA cannot be registered twice
- Once set, it cannot be changed

Registration costs 1000 bytes.

To use registry:
- Change username attestor address to `C67F2UX4VNZZ2RJMPBADG7PRFPZZOT4E`
- Send to @name
